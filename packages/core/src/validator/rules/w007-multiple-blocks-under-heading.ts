      "One block per heading section is the structural convention: each biz42 element gets its own sub-chapter with a heading, prose, and a block as its structured summary. Packing multiple blocks under one heading loses the per-element narrative context — readers cannot tell which prose describes which element. It also makes the document harder to navigate and reference by section.",
