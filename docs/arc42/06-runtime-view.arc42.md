# Runtime View

## Agent-driven Architecture Evolution

This representative Runtime View scenario describes how an architect reads and edits the
architecture workspace with agent assistance. Validation is intentionally shown as an implicit
quality gate at commit or merge time, rather than as a manual step in the architect's workflow.

```

The participant identifiers use underscores because Mermaid does not allow hyphens in participant
IDs. The `aliases` field maps each diagram identifier to its model ID. The actors are external
participants and are therefore not included in the scenario's `involves` list. The architect is
the primary reader and editor of the workspace; the agent assists with the change, while the
pre-commit hook or CI pipeline invokes validation implicitly.

## Core model validation pipeline

The validation quality gate delegates to the core pipeline. This schematic scenario makes the
internal hand-offs explicit: parsing produces the document AST, the builder creates the model, the
resolver indexes references, the validator runs rules, and the renderer prepares output.

```arc42
:::runtime-scenario
id: scenario-core-validation-pipeline
title: Core model validation pipeline
trigger: Pre-commit hook or CI invokes architecture validation
involves: bb-parser, bb-builder, bb-resolver, bb-validator, bb-renderer, bb-workspace-fs, bb-core, bb-cli
:::
```

```arc42
:::diagram
id: core-validation-pipeline-sequence
scenario: scenario-core-validation-pipeline
notation: mermaid-sequence
aliases: bb_parser=bb-parser, bb_builder=bb-builder, bb_resolver=bb-resolver, bb_validator=bb-validator, bb_renderer=bb-renderer, bb_workspace_fs=bb-workspace-fs, bb_cli=bb-cli
:::
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor actor_ci as Pre-commit hook or CI
    participant bb_workspace_fs as Filesystem Workspace Adapter
    participant bb_parser as Markdown Parser
    participant bb_builder as Meta-model Builder
    participant bb_resolver as Reference Resolver
    participant bb_validator as Validator
    participant bb_renderer as Renderer Registry

    actor_ci->>bb_parser: Parse architecture documents
    bb_parser->>bb_builder: Return DocumentAst[]
    bb_builder->>bb_resolver: Return typed Workspace
    bb_resolver->>bb_validator: Return reference index
    bb_workspace_fs->>bb_validator: Inject ValidationContext (path evidence + coverage)
    bb_validator->>bb_renderer: Return diagnostics and workspace result
    bb_renderer-->>actor_ci: Render text or JSON result
```

The scenario shows the five interfaces that connect the core pipeline, plus the path context
injected by the filesystem workspace adapter (`if-workspace-paths`). It is a schematic flow, not a claim that each
stage is a separate process or that rendering is required for every validation invocation.

1. A user asks for an improvement.
2. The agent reads the architecture documentation and finds the relevant system architecture.
3. Based on that architecture, the agent enquires with the user to clarify the requested change.
4. The user provides a response.
5. The agent changes the code.
6. The agent updates the architecture documentation, but may miss some aspects of the change.
7. The agent tries to commit the change, and the pre-commit validation checks the architecture
   documentation and reports an error.
8. The agent reads the validation message and returns to the user for clarification or correction.
9. The user responds.
10. The agent updates the architecture consistently with the code and the clarified change.

## Architect browses workspace via biz42 serve

This scenario describes the flow when an architect or reader opens `biz42 serve` to browse a
workspace in the browser. The CLI starts a local HTTP server, the web renderer loads the workspace
payload, and the reader navigates documentation. The `if-reader-web`, `if-cli-web`, and
`if-web-cli-api` interfaces are all exercised in this scenario.

```arc42
:::runtime-scenario
id: scenario-serve-browser
title: Architect browses workspace via biz42 serve
trigger: Architect runs biz42 serve from the terminal
involves: bb-cli, bb-core, bb-web-renderer
:::
```

```arc42
:::diagram
id: serve-browser-sequence
scenario: scenario-serve-browser
notation: mermaid-sequence
aliases: bb_cli=bb-cli, bb_core=bb-core, bb_web=bb-web-renderer
:::
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor actor_architect as Architect
    participant bb_cli as CLI
    participant bb_core as Core Library
    participant bb_web as Web Renderer

    actor_architect->>bb_cli: biz42 serve (terminal)
    bb_cli->>bb_core: loadWorkspace(dir)
    bb_core-->>bb_cli: WorkspacePayload
    bb_cli->>bb_cli: Start HTTP server on localhost
    bb_cli-->>actor_architect: Listening on http://localhost:3142
    actor_architect->>bb_web: Open browser
    bb_web->>bb_cli: GET /api/workspace
    bb_cli-->>bb_web: WorkspacePayload (JSON)
    bb_web-->>actor_architect: Render documentation
    actor_architect->>bb_web: Navigate documents and element cards
```

The web renderer is a static SPA served from the CLI's distribution directory. The CLI does not
re-parse on every browser request — the workspace payload is loaded once at server startup and
cached in memory for the lifetime of the process.

## Site build with Mermaid validation and verdict loading

This scenario describes the two build-time flows specific to the Project Site and the Mermaid
Syntax building block. During `biz42 validate`, the Validator calls `@biz42/mermaid` to parse
and check Mermaid diagram syntax (W017). Separately, when the Project Site is built, the Verdicts
Vite Plugin reads `docs/verdicts` markdown files and exposes them as a virtual module consumed by
the site's React components.

```arc42
:::runtime-scenario
id: scenario-site-build-verdicts
title: Site build: Mermaid validation and verdict loading
trigger: Architect runs biz42 validate; separately, site build runs
involves: bb-validator, bb-mermaid, bb-site, bb-verdicts, bb-web-renderer
:::
```

```arc42
:::diagram
id: site-build-verdicts-sequence
scenario: scenario-site-build-verdicts
notation: mermaid-sequence
aliases: bb_validator=bb-validator, bb_mermaid=bb-mermaid, bb_site=bb-site, bb_verdicts=bb-verdicts, bb_web_renderer=bb-web-renderer
:::
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor actor_ci as CI / Architect
    participant bb_validator as Validator
    participant bb_mermaid as Mermaid Syntax
    participant bb_web_renderer as Web Renderer
    participant bb_site as Project Site
    participant bb_verdicts as Agent Verdicts

    actor_ci->>bb_validator: biz42 validate (includes W017 rule)
    bb_validator->>bb_mermaid: parseMermaid(diagramSource)
    bb_mermaid-->>bb_validator: MermaidParseResult (ok or failure)
    bb_validator-->>actor_ci: Diagnostics including W017 for invalid syntax

    actor_ci->>bb_web_renderer: biz42 build (web renderer)
    bb_web_renderer-->>actor_ci: dist/ (HTML/JS/CSS)

    actor_ci->>bb_site: vite build (site)
    bb_site->>bb_verdicts: Read docs/verdicts/*.md (via Vite plugin)
    bb_verdicts-->>bb_site: Parsed verdict frontmatter as virtual module
    bb_site-->>actor_ci: Static site with embedded verdict cards
```

`if-mermaid-syntax` is exercised during `biz42 validate` whenever a diagram block is present.
`if-site-verdicts` is exercised only at site build time — no runtime network calls are involved.
`if-site-docs-output` represents the build artifact produced by `biz42 build` and co-deployed under `/docs/` alongside the project site.
