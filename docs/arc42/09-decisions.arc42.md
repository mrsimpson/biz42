# Architecture Decisions

Key decisions made during the design and implementation of the biz42 toolchain.
Each decision is linked to the quality goals it serves via `addresses:`.

## Machine-readable Architecture Without Sacrificing Human Readability

The primary goal of biz42 is to make business model documentation machine-readable
for tooling and AI agents — while keeping it fully readable and writable by humans without
special tooling. This rules out pure YAML/JSON (not human-readable prose), XML-based formats
(too verbose), and embedded code annotations (tied to one language). Markdown was the
natural host format: ubiquitous, renderable everywhere, and familiar to developers and agents
alike. The `:::type` fenced block syntax adds structured data as a lightweight extension that
does not break standard Markdown renderers.

## Monorepo to Ship One Source of Truth to Multiple Audiences

The toolchain is split into `@biz42/core` (parser, model, validator, renderer),
`@doctc/biz42` (human-facing command-line tool), and `@biz42/skill` (agent-facing skill and
templates) — all in one monorepo. This structure lets a single source of truth produce
artefacts for three distinct audiences: agents consuming the skill and templates, humans
using the CLI, and documentation consumers reading the rendered output. A separate-repo
approach would require synchronising the model across repos and risk the skill diverging
from the validator.

## Markdown-flavored DSL with :::type fences

We evaluated pure YAML/JSON, AsciiDoc delimited blocks, MDX (JSX in Markdown), and
`:::type` fenced div syntax (MyST/Pandoc). YAML/JSON is not human-readable prose. MDX
requires a JSX parser and is too complex for agents to generate reliably. AsciiDoc is a
different ecosystem entirely. `:::type` fences are the lightest Markdown extension: simple
delimiters, no nested complexity, compatible with standard renderers that pass through
unknown divs, and friendly to line-oriented parsers. Crucially, the same syntax can be
adopted in AsciiDoc or other host formats in the future without changing the DSL semantics.

title: Use Markdown with :::type fenced blocks as the DSL format

## Line-oriented parser, not tree-sitter

Tree-sitter produces an incremental, structured AST and would enable richer editor
features later. However, there is no canonical `tree-sitter-markdown` grammar; the
Markdown+`:::block` hybrid would require maintaining two grammar rule sets. A simple
line-oriented parser — scan for `:::type` fences, parse key-value pairs inside — covers
all v1 needs with zero grammar maintenance. Tree-sitter can be added later as an
optimisation, not a requirement.

```arc42

id: dec-line-parser
title: Use a line-oriented parser rather than tree-sitter for v1
status: accepted
date: 2026-08-14
addresses: qg-extensibility, qg-agent-writability
:::
```

## Flat hierarchy with parent: references

Building-block decomposition is expressed as a flat list of elements with `parent:` pointers,
not nested `:::building-block` blocks inside other blocks. Nested syntax requires depth tracking
in the parser and is error-prone for agents to produce. A flat list with explicit parent ids
is simpler to parse, simpler to write, and the validator can reconstruct the tree and detect
cycles. The trade-off is that the file is slightly less visually hierarchical.

title: Model building-block hierarchy as flat list with parent references
status: accepted
date: 2026-08-14

## No third-party runtime dependencies

The original v1 target was a runtime made only of Node.js built-ins. The core model schemas now
use Zod at runtime, so that target is superseded rather than silently claimed as true. Removing
Zod would require replacing the schema system and is tracked as technical debt.

```arc42
:::decision
id: dec-no-deps
title: Use only Node.js built-ins at runtime — no third-party packages
status: superseded
date: 2026-08-14
addresses: qg-cli-usability, qg-extensibility
:::
```

## Accept Zod as tracked core runtime technical debt

Zod remains a deliberate runtime dependency of `@biz42/core` because the model schema definitions
currently provide the parser/builder validation boundary. This is accepted technical debt, not a
general policy that core may accumulate dependencies: replacing it requires an explicit schema
validation redesign and separate scope.

```arc42
:::decision
id: dec-zod-runtime-debt
title: Accept Zod as a tracked runtime dependency in core
status: accepted
date: 2026-09-08
supersedes: dec-no-deps

```

## Shared processing pipeline for commands, no caching

Each filesystem-backed command acquires and parses its workspace from scratch before invoking the
core processing pipeline. `validate` additionally runs validation; `get` builds query views, while
`rules` reads static rule metadata. We considered caching the parsed workspace on disk or in memory,
but the added complexity (cache invalidation, stale state, file watching) is not justified for v1
workspace sizes. The pipeline is fast enough (sub-100ms for typical workspaces) that cold-start on
every invocation is acceptable.

```arc42
:::decision
id: dec-no-cache
title: Run the full pipeline on every invocation — no caching in v1
status: accepted
date: 2026-08-14
addresses: qg-verifiability, qg-extensibility
:::
```

## Rule registry with rationale

Validation rules are self-describing objects with metadata including a `rationale` field —
a plain-English explanation of why the rule exists. This makes the rule set understandable
without reading the source code. `biz42 rules` exposes the full registry to CLI users and
agents. The ESLint-inspired structure (meta + check function) makes rules independently
testable and the registry extensible without touching the validator core.

```arc42

status: accepted
date: 2026-08-14
addresses: qg-extensibility, qg-verifiability, qg-agent-writability
:::
```

## Prose-first authoring convention enforced by rules

The DSL enforces a structural convention: every element lives in its own `##` section,
with prose explaining purpose and rationale before the `:::block`. Two validation rules
(W004, W005) catch violations. This is not arbitrary style — it ensures the documentation
is useful to human readers, not just a machine-readable index. A business model document
where every block is naked metadata has failed at its primary purpose.

```arc42
:::decision
id: dec-prose-first
title: Enforce prose-first authoring convention with W004 and W005 rules
status: accepted
date: 2026-08-17
addresses: qg-readability, qg-verifiability, con-markdown-authoring
:::
```

## Runtime Without Production Dependencies

The core library and CLI use Node.js built-ins at runtime. The project accepts the resulting dependency constraints because a small, locked-down toolchain is easier to install and audit.

```arc42

id: dec-runtime-builtins
title: Use Node.js built-ins for runtime functionality

:::
```

## Focused v1 Element Model

The v1 model covers the 12 biz42 ISO 9001 sections that can be represented as typed, cross-referenceable elements. Diagram-heavy context, runtime, deployment, and solution views remain prose-only until the AST supports richer graph structures.

```arc42

```

## Starter Templates as Authoring Guidance

The starter files provide complete examples for every supported block type and use the same one-heading-per-element convention as the project documentation. They are intentionally neutral so agents can copy the structure without copying domain-specific architecture.

```arc42
